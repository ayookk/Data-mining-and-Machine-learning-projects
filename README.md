Part 1 is  code implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier, which is one of the simplest yet effective machine learning algorithms. Here's what the code does:

First, it implements two distance metrics that are commonly used in KNN:

Euclidean distance (straight-line distance between two points)
Manhattan distance (sum of absolute differences, like walking along city blocks)


The code then uses scikit-learn to generate a synthetic dataset with:

50 training samples
2 features (making it easy to visualize)
2 classes (binary classification)


The main KNN logic:

Takes a single test point [0.5, 0.5]
Calculates its distance to every training point
Finds the 6 nearest neighbors (k=6)
Uses majority voting among these neighbors to predict the class
This is a classic example of a supervised learning algorithm where the prediction for a new point is based on the classes of its nearest neighbors in the training set. It's often used as an introductory machine learning project because it's intuitive and doesn't require complex mathematical concepts like gradient descent or probability theory. 


Part 2 is a code implements Gradient Boosting, which is a powerful ensemble learning algorithm. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

Initial Setup:
Uses the Iris dataset, focusing on the first two features for training
Calculates the mean of target values (h0) as the initial prediction
It mean serves as the first "weak learner" in the ensemble

Boosting Process:

Runs for 3 iterations (T=3)
In each iteration:

Calculates current predictions using all previous models
Computes residuals (difference between true values and predictions)
Trains a new decision tree (max_depth=2) on these residuals
Adds the new tree to the ensemble if it improves predictions

Key Components:

Uses shallow decision trees as weak learners
Each new tree tries to correct the mistakes of previous trees
Residuals guide the learning process - new trees focus on what previous trees got wrong
The ensemble combines all trees for final predictions

This is a classic implementation of gradient boosting, which is the foundation for popular algorithms like XGBoost and LightGBM. The algorithm builds an additive model in a forward stage-wise manner, where each new tree tries to correct the prediction errors of the previous ensemble.


Part 3 implements and compares two versions of the Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) ensemble method, which is a fundamental machine learning technique. Here's the key points:

Basic Version (First Implementation):

Uses Decision Trees as base classifiers
Creates multiple models trained on different bootstrap samples (random subsets) of the data
Makes predictions by majority voting among all trees
Uses the Iris dataset for classification


Random Forest Version (Second Implementation in paste.txt):

Replaces simple Decision Trees with Random Forest classifiers
Each base model is itself an ensemble (Random Forest with 5 trees)
Creates a "double ensemble" effect - bagging of random forests


Analysis Features:

Both versions include visualization of how accuracy changes with the number of classifiers
Tests ensemble sizes from 1 to 50 classifiers
Plots show:

Performance trend as ensemble size increases
Original implementation point (n=10)
Best performing configuration
Clear comparison of accuracy improvements

The main difference between the two approaches is that the second version (Random Forest) typically achieves better accuracy due to its additional layer of ensemble learning. Both implementations demonstrate the core concept of bagging: combining multiple models trained on different subsets of data to create a more robust classifier.
